# Diabetes Prediction Using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Algorithms

##  Introduction

This project investigates the prediction of diabetes in patients to determine whether they have diabetes and, if so, the type of diabetes. Two machine learning methods, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms, are applied to a dataset that includes various patient characteristics such as:
- Gender
- Age
- Hypertension
- Heart disease
- Smoking history
- BMI
- HbA1c levels
- Blood glucose levels

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises over 100,000 patients, including their medical history. The goal is to identify diabetic patients and classify the type of diabetes they have.

### Background
Diabetes is a chronic condition that involves the body either not producing insulin or not producing sufficient insulin, resulting in health complications such as kidney and heart disease. The two main types of diabetes are:

- **Type 1 Diabetes**: An autoimmune reaction where the body attacks itself and stops producing insulin. It is the most common form of diabetes.
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: A condition where the body becomes resistant to insulin, leading to high blood glucose levels. This type is more commonly diagnosed in adults.

### Purpose
In this study, we analyze various health factors related to diabetes, such as blood glucose levels, using machine learning techniques. 
This project was undertaken to apply the key concepts and skills learned in my Data Analytics course.

##  Objectives

1. **Evaluate Key Factors**: Identify which factors have the greatest influence on a person's likelihood of having diabetes.
2. **Apply Machine Learning Methods**: Use Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms to predict and classify diabetes types.
3. **Data Analysis and Cleaning**: Analyze the dataset to understand the underlying factors and perform necessary data cleaning.
4. **Data Visualization**: Present the findings clearly through visual representations for better understanding.
5. **Model Assessment**: Evaluate the performance of the models and check for precision to ensure accuracy.
